# Take-Home Assignment: CSS Styling Mastery

## Assignment Title:

**“Transform a Plain Page with CSS”**

---

# Instructions for Students

You are given (or you must create) a simple HTML page using the HTML elements you learned from W3Schools.

Your task is to transform the page using CSS only.

The focus of this assignment is CSS — not HTML.

# Project Structure

```
css-project/
│
├── index.html
└── styles.css
```

---

# Part 1: HTML Requirements (Review Only)

Your HTML should include:

* `h1`
* At least two `h2`
* At least three paragraphs
* One list (`ul` or `ol`)
* One link (`a`)
* One `div`
* One element with an id
* Two elements sharing the same class

Keep the HTML clean and simple. No inline styling except where required below.

---

# Part 2: CSS Requirements (Main Focus)

All major styling must be done inside `styles.css`.

You must demonstrate the following:

## 1. Universal Selector

Add margin or padding to all elements.

## 2. Element Selector

Style all paragraphs.

## 3. Class Selector

Style multiple elements with the same class.

## 4. ID Selector

Style one specific section differently.

## 5. Grouping Selector

Style `h1, h2` together.

## 6. Descendant Selector

Example: `div p`
Style only paragraphs inside a div.

## 7. Hover Effect

Add a hover effect to links.

---

# Part 3: CSS Application Types

You must show all three ways of adding CSS:

### External CSS

Main styling must be in `styles.css`.

### Internal CSS

Inside `<style>` in the head:

* Change the background color of the page.

### Inline CSS

Use inline CSS on ONE element only.

---

# Part 4: Demonstrate Cascading

You must:

* Apply a style using an element selector (e.g., `p`)
* Override it using a class or id selector
* Show that the more specific selector wins

---

# Part 5: Comments

Include:

* At least 3 CSS comments
* At least 1 HTML comment

---

# Part 6: Avoid These Errors

Do not:

* Forget semicolons
* Leave braces unclosed
* Misspell properties
* Write incorrect values like `15 px`
* Mix up `class` and `id`

---

# Bonus (Optional)

* Add borders and padding to create a styled content box
* Use `text-align`
* Change font family
* Use different background colors for sections
* Create a simple layout using width and margin
